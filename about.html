                <h3>Hi guys! So today I wanted to talk about a latest trend for all the coffee lovers out there which, I think is a must try. I, personally, am a coffee lover and I would choose coffee to tea any day.
                    <br> I have a love for strong coffee beverages, so recently, I tried this cold coffee beverage which was a Vegan Cold Brewed Coffee and I must say I absolutely loved it. 
                    <br>You must be thinking, why am I writing about this specific preparation of coffee. Let me tell you the answer to that.
                    <br>You all would be surprised to know, like I was, that when it comes to the pros and cons of having coffee, a preparation of cold brewed coffee has an added advantage. Factually speaking, and according to a study done by Toddy,<br> the hot brewed coffee is 67% more acidic than the cold brewed coffee. Also, guess what!  Since the coffee grounds of this preparation are not prepared in high temperatures, the flavours of the coffee seeps into the beverage preparation and hence, is more beverage as well as less bitter than the normal hot brewed coffee.
                    <br>A Cold Brewed Coffee is nowadays, mostly favoured by the millennials, as they are more open to experimentation with their food and beverage preferences. Studies show that amongst the coffee lovers, majority being millennials, <br>try various innovations of coffee preparation and flavours including Cappuccinos, Lattes, Frappuccino, Ristretto, Affogato, cold brew and much more.</h3>
